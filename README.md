# 42_Printf
Printf function rewrited using C language  //  42 School project

Just make to produce libftprintf.a, then include it in your project to use printf function.

Behaviors reproduced:

- c, s, p, % conversions
- d, i, u, x, X conversions
- -, 0, and * flags

When made with 'make bonus':

- n, o conversions
- +, ' ' and # flags (# not really working)
